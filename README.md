**Update 2012-07-28**: ThinAir is now _Ready for development_. What it means is that developers who want to try the framework and develop project with it are now welcome to do so! Documentation is almost 100% finished, if anything seems missing, please open an issue.

## Goals

The main goal of *ThinAir* is to give a basic but versatile set of tools to Node.js user and newcomers for building web applications. 

This ain't no revolution, but a simple, concised way of achieving what you want without having to re-invent the wheel.

Another goal I have in mind while doing this project is to show everyone (even *PHP* developers!) that Node.js projects are fun, flexible and can finally replace those old technologies once and for all.


## Documentation

2012-07-28: Docs are finally done! Not deeply explanatory but still, every component of ThinAir has been covered. If any questions are left to be answered do not hesitate to open an issue!


## Installation

There's no **NPM** package yet because some of the packages used aren't very modulable. But it's certain that it will become available in a near future.

To install ThinAir, you'll need to fork this repository of clone it and simply replace the stuff from the _app/_ directory with your stuff. Simple as this.


## Usage

To start ThinAir, simply type:
```
node core.js
```

You can read more  about ThinAir usage in the [wiki](https://github.com/tbergeron/ThinAir/wiki).

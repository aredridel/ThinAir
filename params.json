What it means is that developers who want to try the framework and develop project with it are now welcome to do so! Documentation is almost 100% finished, if anything seems missing, please open an issue. \r\n\r\n##### Update 2012-07-27\r\nDocs are finally done! Not deeply explanatory but still, every component of ThinAir has been covered. If any questions are left to be answered do not hesitate to open an issue!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nThe main goal of *ThinAir* is to give a basic but versatile set of tools to Node.js user and newcomers for building web applications. \r\n\r\nThis ain't no revolution, but a simple, concised way of achieving what you want without having to re-invent the wheel.\r\n\r\nAnother goal I have in mind while doing this project is to show everyone (even *PHP* developers!) that Node.js projects are fun, flexible and can finally replace those old technologies once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThere's no **npm** package yet because some of the packages used aren't very modulable. But it's certain that it will become available in a near future.\r\n\r\nTo install ThinAir, you'll need to fork this repository of clone it and simply replace the stuff from the _app/_ directory with your stuff. Simple as this.\r\n\r\nBe sure though, to run `npm install` before trying to use anything. (This will install ThinAir's dependencies).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo start ThinAir, simply type:\r\n```\r\nnode core.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can read more  about ThinAir usage in the [wiki](https://github.com/tbergeron/ThinAir/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\nSince there's no **npm** yet, I made a little auto-update bash script that you can simply use by doing `./updateThinAir.sh`. What it does is, it clones ThinAir in a temporary directory, replaces the `package.json` and the `libs/` directory with the new content and finally runs `npm install` to get the latest dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n - [Tommy Bergeron](https://github.com/tbergeron)\r\n - [Raynos](https://github.com/Raynos)\r\n - [Florian Margaine](https://github.com/Ralt)\r\n - [Hubert Perron](https://github.com/hubertperron)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to [Raynos](https://github.com/Raynos) for his help, patience and nCore (nCore is GREAT!)\r\n\r\nThanks to [Florian Margaine](https://github.com/Ralt) for all the time you've spent helping me finding great solutions!\r\n\r\nThanks to [Hubert Perron](https://github.com/hubertperron) for kicking my ass in the good direction when I'm trying too hard to reinvent the wheel! ;-)\r\n","google":"UA-6756116-13"}
